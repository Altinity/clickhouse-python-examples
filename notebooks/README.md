# Juypter Notebooks for ClickHouse

This directory contains sample notebooks showing how to connect Python
to ClickHouse. 

Notebook code has been tested on Ubuntu using Anaconda and Python 3.7.
They should work from Python 3.5 onwards.

To get started you'll need to add the following packages using conda:
```
conda install -c conda-forge clickhouse-driver
conda install -c conda-forge clickhouse-sqlalchemy
```

Examples use sample data from the iris dataset.
